this project implement a set of num metod for working with polinomial inciude evaluation ,deruvatuon,root,lengthand area
polynimial evaluation ex:f(x)=a0+a1*x+a2*x^2+...
root finding an appromximate root of the equation p(x)=0
polypoint build a polynom point  (2 point line) or(3 point parbula)
alse do all the opration add two polinom, multiple  two poly, compute the derivative, parse polinomial from string
i find the length  ande area too
length approximate the kength of a curve using straight lije segment
about the area i compute the signed area betwwen to curve by finding intersection point,splitting the rangeandusing trapeziod

about the graph we have two poly blue =0.02x^4-0.02x^3-0.7x^2+1.0x+2.0,green 0.08x^3-0.06x^2-1.4x+1.0
intersection pount x~-5.2099,x~-0.3808,x~3.6169,x~6.9739
area using 16 trapiz=37.0283
